## About Me
When I was attending Rockland Community College I had taken a course titled "Web Development Programming" in which I learned the basics of creating websites. My final for this website was to create any
website of my choosing. Given my background as an art major from high school I chose to create an artist's portfolio to display all the different types of artwork I've created, ranging from
photography, short films, and 2D/3D creations. I've added images, embedded Youtube videos, and created a form that would send messages to my Professor's server. It was in that class that I began to develop
a passion for coding.

In this class I am excited to develop new skills to create more enhanced websites. The Bulma assignment has already provided insight of different ways to stylize websites without the need of creating
a CSS file.
